# Random Forest with Python Â· Airline Survey

**Context**

The airline is interested in predicting whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience. The airline would like me, as a consultant, to construct and evaluate a model that can accomplish this goal. In this step I am building a Random Forest classifier.
